# WhatsApp-Pi
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-black.svg?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/RaphaCastelloes/whatsapp-pi)

A WhatsApp integration extension for the **[Pi Coding Agent](https://pi.dev)**. 

Pi is a powerful agentic AI coding assistant that operates in your terminal. This extension lets you chat and pair-program with your Pi agent through WhatsApp, with message filtering, allowed contacts/groups, recents/history browsing, message detail/reply, group-only binding, and reliable message delivery.


## Features

- **Manual WhatsApp Connection**: QR code-based authentication with session persistence
- **Allowed Contacts**: Control which phone numbers can interact with Pi
  - Add contacts with optional names for easy identification
  - View ignored numbers (not yet allowed) and add them when needed
  - Manage aliases and print allowed contacts from the menu
- **Allowed Groups**: Control which WhatsApp groups can interact with Pi
  - Add group JIDs with optional aliases
  - Only groups in Allowed Groups are processed by the agent
- **Recents & History**: Browse recent conversations, inspect full message history, and reply from message detail view
- **Reliable Messaging**: Queue-based message sending with retry logic
- **TUI Integration**: Menu-driven interface for managing connections, contacts, and recent chats
- **Group-Only Mode**: Bind the agent to a single WhatsApp group with `--whatsapp-group`
- **Media Support**: 
  - **Vision Analysis**: Automatically forwards WhatsApp images to Pi for analysis.
  - **Audio Transcription**: Transcribes voice notes locally with Whisper.cpp (`whisper-cpp-node`); `ffmpeg` is used to convert WhatsApp audio to 16 kHz mono WAV first.
  - **Document Handling**: Downloads and stores documents (PDF, text) for agent access; PDFs include a bounded text preview when readable.

## Prerequisites

### Pi Coding Agent

Install Pi from [pi.dev](https://pi.dev):

**Linux / macOS (recommended):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://pi.dev/install.sh | sh
```

**Or via npm (requires Node.js 20+):**
```bash
npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Then authenticate or set an API key before starting:
```bash
# Use /login inside Pi for subscription providers, or set an API key:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# Google Gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

See the [Pi documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest) for full setup, providers, and model configuration details.

### Audio Transcription

Audio transcription uses a local `whisper.cpp` CLI and FFmpeg; no transcription API key is required.

Install dependencies and build the Whisper CLI:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
npm install
./scripts/build-whisper-cli.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
npm install
./scripts/build-whisper-cli.ps1
```

The CLI is expected at `vendor/whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli` (or `.exe` on Windows). To use another location, set `WHISPER_CLI_PATH`.

PDF documents are parsed locally and do not require extra system utilities.
If a PDF cannot be parsed automatically, it is still saved and forwarded with a clear fallback notice.

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension:
```bash
pi install npm:whatsapp-pi
```

2. Start Pi:
```bash
pi
```

3. Open `/whatsapp` and choose **Connect / Reconnect WhatsApp**.
   - QR appears only on first pair or after logoff.

4. Add the chat you will use with Pi to **Allowed Contacts** or **Allowed Groups**.

5. Send a message from that allowed chat to Pi.
   - Pi replies in same thread.
   - Use **Recents** only to browse history or reply manually.

After first pairing, you can start Pi with auto-connect enabled:
```bash
pi --whatsapp-pi-online
```

### Iniciar automaticamente no Ubuntu

Com `tmux` instalado, o instalador abaixo instala `whatsapp-pi` no agente Pi do usuário e cria um serviço systemd que inicia `pi --whatsapp-pi-online` em um tmux no boot:

```bash
sudo apt install tmux
./scripts/install-whatsapp-pi-service.sh
```

Comandos úteis:
```bash
tmux attach -t whatsapp-pi
systemctl --user status whatsapp-pi.service
systemctl --user disable --now whatsapp-pi.service
```

## Development / Testing

If you are developing or testing the extension locally, you can clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/RaphaCastelloes/whatsapp-pi):

1. Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaphaCastelloes/whatsapp-pi.git
cd whatsapp-pi
npm install
```

2. Run the extension:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
pi -e whatsapp-pi.ts
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
./scripts/launch-pi.ps1
```

For verbose mode (shows Baileys trace logs and audio timing logs for debugging):
```bash
pi -e whatsapp-pi.ts --verbose
```

To test startup auto-connect locally after you have already paired WhatsApp:
```bash
pi -e whatsapp-pi.ts --whatsapp-pi-online
```

## How It Works

- Pi processes **incoming** messages only from allowed contacts or allowed groups.
- **Recents** is history browser, not trigger.
- **Send Message** and `send_wa_message` are outbound only.
- If you message yourself, WhatsApp may show sent/read ticks, but that does not guarantee Pi will treat it as a trigger.

## LLM-Callable Tools

The extension registers the following tools that the Pi agent can call:

| Tool | Direction | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `send_wa_message` | outbound | Send a WhatsApp message to a contact or group (or reply to the last conversation if `jid` is omitted). |
| `send_reaction` | outbound | React to a WhatsApp message with an emoji. |
| `list_wa_conversations` | read-only | List recent conversations from the local recents store. Supports `onlyIncoming`, `onlyAllowed`, and `limit`. |
| `get_wa_conversation_history` | read-only | Get the most recent messages with a given `senderNumber` (accepts `+E164`, raw digits, or a JID). Supports `limit`. |
| `check_wa_new_messages` | read-only | List conversations whose most recent message is incoming (i.e. waiting for a reply). Supports `sinceTimestamp` (ms epoch). |

The three read-only tools query the local recents store at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/whatsapp-pi/recents/recents.json`. They never touch the network and do not mark messages as read.

## WhatsApp Numbers and JIDs

- Contacts use phone format in UI: `+5511999999999`
- Internally, contacts map to JIDs like `5511999999999@s.whatsapp.net`
- Groups use JIDs like `120363012345@g.us`
- Recents may show normalized values from WhatsApp, so use **Print Contact** / **Print Group JID** and aliases to avoid confusion.

## Commands

- `/whatsapp` - Open the WhatsApp management menu

### Main Menu Options
- **Connect / Reconnect WhatsApp** - Start WhatsApp connection using saved credentials when available; QR code appears only if pairing is required
- **Disconnect WhatsApp** - Stop WhatsApp connection
- **Logoff (Delete Session)** - Remove all credentials and session data
- **Recents** - Open recent conversations, view history, and reply
- **Allowed Contacts** - Manage contacts that can interact with Pi
- **Allowed Groups** - Manage WhatsApp groups that can interact with Pi

### Allowed Contacts Management
- **Add Contact** - Add a new contact to the allowed contacts list (format: +5511999999999)
- **Select a contact** - Open a submenu with **History**, **Send Message**, **Print Contact**, **Add Alias**, **Remove Alias**, **Add Number**, **Remove Number**, **Remove Contact**, and **Back**
- **Back** - Return to main menu

### Allowed Groups Management
- **Add Group** - Add a WhatsApp group JID to the allowed groups list (format: 120363012345@g.us)
- **Select a group** - Open a submenu with **History**, **Send Message**, **Print Group JID**, **Add Alias**, **Remove Alias**, **Remove Group**, and **Back**

### Recents Management
- **History** - Open full message history for that conversation
- **Send Message** - Send a new message without Pi suffix
- **Reply** - Open message detail, then press `R` to reply
- **Allow Contact / Allow Group** - Move a recent sender into the appropriate allowed list
- **Remove Alias** - Clear saved alias for that sender
- **Back** - Return to main menu

### WhatsApp Chat Commands
Send these commands directly in WhatsApp to control the agent session:

- **`/sessions`** - List sessions across all projects, grouped by project
- **`/resume <n|id>`** - Switch to a session (moves the working directory to its project) and get a short recap
- **`/new [title]`** - Start a new session, optionally named
- **`/title <name>`** - Rename the active session
- **`/branch [n]`** - Fork the active session from an earlier point
- **`/undo`** - Rewind past the last exchange
- **`/compact [instructions]`** - Compact the active context (alias: `/compress`)
- **`/abort`** - Interrupt the running turn (alias: `/stop`)
- **`/help`** - Show the command list

Read-only commands (`/sessions`, `/help`) answer immediately. Commands that change session state
are deferred while the agent is busy and applied in order once the current turn finishes; `/abort`
runs immediately and discards any deferred commands. Session commands are handled by the extension
and are never forwarded to the model.

When the agent runs under the bundled systemd/tmux supervisor, the active session is written to
`~/.pi/agent/extensions/whatsapp-pi/active-session.json` and restored on restart, so a restart
continues the same session instead of starting a new one.

## Notes

- `--whatsapp-pi-online` auto-connects when credentials already exist.
- `--whatsapp-group <jid>` binds Pi to one WhatsApp group.
- Media handling is local: images for vision, audio via Whisper.cpp + ffmpeg, documents stored under `.pi-data/whatsapp/documents/`.
- Recents/history live in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/whatsapp-pi/recents/recents.json`.
- The active-session pointer lives in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/whatsapp-pi/active-session.json` and is used by `scripts/whatsapp-pi-tmux.sh` to resume the session after a restart.
- Session state, allow lists, and startup reconnects are persisted locally.
